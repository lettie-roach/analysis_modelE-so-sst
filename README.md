This repository contains all code and processed data to reproduce the figures in the paper.


`\data_modelE-so-sst`: stores processed model and observational data files (in NetCDF) used by analysis scripts

`\analysis`: contains Python notebooks for analysis and plotting. These should run out of the box using the data provided

`\processing`: constains the code used to create the processed model and observational files from raw model output and publicly-available data products. Other users will need to modify the file paths for their own systems
